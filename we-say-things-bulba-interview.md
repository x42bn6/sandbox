### Rapid fire round (00:04:00)
- **Playing or coaching?** Playing
- **Pre-7.00 or post-7.00?** Post-7.00
- **Storm Spirit or anything else?** Storm Spirit
- **Cake or pie?** Pie

### Introduce yourself (00:05:15)
- Before Dota, wanted to become a doctor and a general typical good Indian son
- Parents are from India
- Is an only child
- As a child, loved trivia and competition.  Loved Jeopardy, and managed to meet his idol Ken Jennings.
- Has been playing Dota 1 since it became public
- Played other video games as a child - mostly Blizzard games
- Had to hide video game habit from parents ("visiting friends") - parents used to read scary news articles about kids being kidnapped via video games
- Went to college - University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill - pre-Med
- Fan of Duke and UNC but Duke was insanely expensive
- When he joined UNC, Dota 1 was still going on
- Played casually.  Wanted a single room because used "colourful" language while playing
- Got pretty decent in NA back then, but didn't go to any LANs.
- Wasn't sure how good relatively to Europe, ping was high, so he didn't play against them
- Played in inhouse leagues like ICS and IDEC, with players like Synderen, Puppey, Kuro, PGG and Garter
- Fear was a legend back then.  After coming back from class, even at high school, he used to watch Fear play the big names such as MYM, VP, and Dendi in Ukrainian teams
- Dota became his next thing after trivia
- Didn't enjoy school - did it as an obligation more than anything.  Half-assed his studies
- Towards the end of Dota 1, he got to play in MYM Prime Nations (World Cup of Dota back then).  Fear asked him to make an NA team, alongside Demon, PowerNet ("the original Arteezy, good at farming and laning" - Synderen agrees), Hai Lua
- Demon was a legend in Dota 1 - mechanically-excellent, top 3 besides China
- Back then, he was mostly a midlaner, playing playmaker heroes like Clockwerk, Rubick, and Disruptor.  Anything that can make things happen
- In MYM Prime Nations, the Denmark stack (Maelk, Mania), Russia stack (Vigoss), Ukraine stack (Dendi, Goblak, DkPhobos) were great
- Used to flame a lot unless he was on a team
- Thought Synderen was very good back then (he had his own team, and consistently placed top 5-10)
- There was a lot of beef and trash-talking back then
- Watched replays and Gosugamers content (Reddit before Reddit)

### What happened to school?/Dota 2 (00:20:00)
- Won MYM Prime Nations at the end of his 2nd year
- 3rd year: Dota 2 and The International announced
- Wasn't a fan of Dota 2.  Thought it was a scam (they had been scammed by TOs and teams), and the $1m was too good to be true
- Parents asked if he would go into esports as a career: "Of course not.  This is just a game"
- Was heading to India for a holiday and to visit relatives.  Before this, Fear asked him to join OK.Nirvana for The International
- Unfortunately, he ended up going to India instead
- Ended up casting the tournament with Draskyl on NeoDota, and felt rather depressed because he wasn't at the event
- While reflecting on TI1: No real roles back then.  Any hero went anywhere.  So when a Chinese team went aggro trilane, his mind was blown
- He saw how big the tournament was, and decided he wanted to go to TI2
- For his junior year (3rd year for non-Americans) - he dropped out of college without telling his  parents.  He told them they had an internship at a lab, and they they paid for an apartment to help out
- Of course, he played Dota all day and night.  When his parents visited, he pretended to do homework
- He and Universe were on It's Gosu eSports at the time.  They were both approached to join EG, alongside Demon, Fear and Maelk

### TI2 (00:23:23)
- Back then, Valve would just announce teams who would take part at The International 2.  There was lots of hype, with a countdown.  Some teams missed out and there was drama as a result.  But they were one of the few choosen.
- Unfortunately, they didn't do well
- Was mid for EG.  The only good Western mids back then were Dendi and G.  **SUNSfan:** Synderen was mid right?  **Synderen:** I wasn't very good
- Didn't really get to play against Eastern teams beforehand
- Back then, he was a fan of the "mid Gods of China": Super and Ferrari_430.  He watched most of their replays
- His favourite heroes back then were Tinker, Storm Spirit, and Invoker
- Super had the best Storm Spirit, so he watched these replays
- Strong heroes here were Dragon Knight, Storm Spirit, and Batrider.  Super was the king of all three
- They ended up owning groups
- People were playing Morphling mid which he found annoying
- Tinker was perma-banned against them.  Apparently he played some annoying March of the Machines strategy at another tournament, and beat Na\`Vi with it, so teams started banning it against him
- Made winners bracket, where they played IG (vs. Ferrari_430).  It was his first time on stage.  Ferrari_430 played Templar Assassin, against his Quas-Wex Invoker.  He got massacred
- Since he used to trash-talk back then, and his fans used to love it, the blowback of losing was brutal
- Ferrari_430 did all sort of tricks that Western players were unaware of
- After TI2, he got kicked.  Demon made a meme video about him being kicked.  The kick was super-demoralising

### Graduation and to TI3 (00:32:09)
- Told his parents about the fake lab several years after this (i.e. they thought he was working at the lab, but was also really good at Dota)
- Didn't want to drop out of college entirely, with nothing to show for it.  So he went back to finish his degree, whilst playing professionally for TI3.
- Didn't get into medical school, but got a Double Major in Biology and Political Science (Political Science was a meme degree).  (SUNSfan points out his brother has such a degree)
- Wanted "Double Major" because it looked cooler
- Wanted to do Chemistry and Biology, but struggled with Chemistry
- Played at TI3 with Liquid
- Main motivation - get revenge on EG for kicking him
- This was a ragtag team, hastily put together.  He thinks they did pretty well considering the circumstances
- Didn't consider Europe to be that good besides Na\`Vi
- Thought they were the best Western team besides Na\`Vi.  Fnatic were also pretty good back then, but they used to beat them most of the time
- Became a better person that year: He conquered his bad thoughts about the departure, and trash-talked less
- Didn't get a lot of offers after TI2, but got a lot of offers after TI3
- On his team, he considers TC to have been one of the best teammates he ever had.  Korok was very good.  Universe was a good friend
- Despite this, he chose to leave good times for bigger names (**SUNSfan:** Like DC...)

### Between TI3-4 (00:38:20)
- This was when Arteezy came onto the scene
- The team shuffled after TI3.  ixMike and Korok were kicked (although he can't remember why they kicked Korok), replacing them with Qojqva and waytoosexy.  Qojqva was chosen because he played all the broken heroes like Nature's Prophet
- Unfortunately, the team got much worse
- Thinks FLUFFNSTUFF and waytoosexy both tried to be captains, so there were lots of arguments
- Considers FLUFFNSTUFF to have been a very good captain.  Very motivational, nice person, and hard worker
- FLUFFNSTUFF is now a day trader, and is well-off now
- FLUFFNSTUFF eventually left the team, and he shifted from core to support.  He felt he had to take more of a leadership role with FLUFFNSTUFF leaving

### TI4 (00:42:20)
- Crazy group stage, all BO1.  It was very close, and the most intense group stage he's been in
- They beat the good teams but lost to teams like mousesports and Arrow Gaming
- They lost the tiebreakers, which was a hard loss to take

### Between TI4-5 (00:43:49)
- Left Liquid and the NA boys
- Has praise for Victor Goossens (Liquid CEO)
- Joined Team Tinker, then a subsidiary of EG.  It was considered a "super-team"
- **Synderen:** This is when all the salaries started skyrocking.  Previously - it was $100-$200 per month, but now it was several thousands
- Started becoming lazy and playing other games.  He wasn't playing well in general
- Thus far in his career, he's gone from mid, to offlane, to 4, to 5.  Unfortunately, his performances at position 5 were very poor
- There was a lot of ego in the team.  Lots of hot heads.  This team was "How to not make a good team, 101"
- He eventually joined mousesports
- Tangent: Back then, people looked down on the HoN players (this is when the rest started moving over)
- **SUNSfan:** Was it just because it was a different game?  Would it have been the same with LoL, for example?  **BuLba:** HoN players had a lot of personality, with lots of trash talk, especially players like Moonmeander, Kyle, and ppd.  zai though was chill.  Notail and Fly switched earlier, but they were different in terms of personality than the NA HoN crowd.  That Fnatic team was quite lovable
- More socialising back then.  Nowadays everyone is in team rooms
- Was socially awkward back then, so he wasn't that comfortable in that atmosphere
- Didn't qualify to TI5, notably losing to Kyle (that hurt)

### TI5 as EG coach (00:53:20)
- Phil Aram has been one of the most influential people in his life: a father figure
- During an X-Games tournament in Austin, he talked to Charlie Yang, ppd, Fear and Aui, who were interested in him being their coach
- Coaching was new at the time (Mikasa was one of the few coaches for Newbee)
- Sumail was quite shy back then
- He went to their bootcamp in Boston with Phil
- Is a big replay nerd.  He studied a lot of replays for them
- Wanted to use this opportunity learn - EG won DAC, so he wanted to learn from that
- Didn't do it for the money, just wanted to help his friends
- Bootcamp was fun.  Aui said the team was very professional
- A lot of jokes in the team still.  Fear and Charlie were jokers
- Was a big fan of CDEC.  They had scrimmed CDEC a few times
- Sumail demolished everyone mid, so they always had a huge advantage.  Nobody knew how to deal with Sumail back then, which wouldn't be the case in modern Dota
- **Aui did one of the nicest things for him.  While bootcamping in Alameda, Phil, Aui and him were in the same car.  Aui asked about the deal he had with the team (there was none).  Aui then said that if they ended up winning and felt you did a good job, we'll get you something.**
- Learnt a lot from the team, like ppd's shotcalling, Charlie on how he managed the team well and kept things in line, and how EG communicated
- The only main source of tension was in group stages where they got Brooded (by Vega Squadron?)
- Played Complexity 1st round in the playoffs, where he got some pleasure in watching Sumail dumpster Kyle
- Lost to CDEC in winners bracket, so they spent time with Aui and Fear to review all the games.  ppd joined later
- The CDEC loss hurt them a lot.  Secret had already lost, so there was a good vibe that they could win the overall title (and they beat CDEC all the time).  Still, the loss taught them a lot
- Punched the TV in the room when they won.  Aui paid for the TV
- Charlie asked if he wanted to stay as coach, but he wanted to go back to play.  Didn't want to coach long-term

### Between TI5-6 (01:02:40)
- Of course, as we all know, Aui got kicked
- **Aui sent him a portion of the prize money while he was on holiday.  Doesn't disclose the amount, but it was substantial**
- Nobody else gave him a portion of the prize money
- **SUNSfan:** Was it a surprise Aui got kicked?  **BuLba:** A big reason was Arteezy - everyone thought Arteezy was the star of Secret.  Sumail had a lot of respect for Arteezy, but not much for others.  Sumail thought Arteezy was the only one who could beat him in mid (which was true).
- Fear had arm injury issues and wanted to swap roles
- Stresses he wasn't there at the time of the kick
- Ended up joining DC with Aui
- **SUNSfan:** FML, we chose this roster over OG [ed: original roster was awful]
- **SUNSfan:** Astronomical improvement over old roster after swap (-Biryu +1437 -TC +Reso -Yawar +Saksa)
- Thought Reso was the best mid on Europe at the time.  Always was a beast, and always will be (see also: TI11)
- Saksa was an unknown at the time.  He and Aui scouted and researched him.  Pleasantly surprised at how good he turned out to be
- Regret: After winning TI5, he and Aui put a lot of pressure on the team.  They had unfair expectations - "just be like Sumail"
- Team atmosphere was good
- Didn't want to make same mistakes for TI4-5 where he got lazy, so he started grinding.  He reached rank 1 in NA at some point
- EG approached him and Aui again (**SUNSfan:** This was a few days before the roster lock)
- Was friends with Arteezy since TI2, did lane practice with him a lot
- A lot of internal issues on EG
- They used to play well in practice matches, but a lot worse in officials
- Got kicked after Manila Major
- Joined Secret.  They still considered him to be a good offlaner, and were also interested in his leadership from the offlane.  They wanted this foil for EternalEnvy and Arteezy
- EternalEnvy and Arteezy were good friends with him.  The three were collectively considered to be the goons of the team
- Talked with Puppey a lot in Istanbul on bootcamp during the coup
- Qualifiers were hard
- *(SUNSfan sends BuLba some message, asks if it's OK to talk about - BuLba says no)*

### TI6 (01:15:00)
- Lots of smart ideas on the team, from Puppey, Aui, EternalEnvy, and pieliedie.  The main problem - too many ideas!
- EternalEnvy and Arteezy both wanted to be stars, so they had a lot of arguments
- Somehow ended up drafting Alchemist and Terrorblade together, for example
- They bombed out
- Rather demoralising considering he tried so hard this year
- Some regrets - he was too casual with voicelines (?) during matches, his communication was not as good, and he got distracted too often

### To TI7 (01:17:15)
- Tangent: After TI5, he bombed out of Frankfurt Major vs. Ritsu with Digital Chaos.  So he went back to coach EG again for Frankfurt Major, getting top 3
- Tangent - Majors were cool.  **Synderen:** Shanghai Major was a mess but the players loved it
- Didn't qualify for Shanghai.  Blitz was at Liquid while sharing casting duties, and spoke with him about coaching Liquid.
- At the time, he didn't know the Liquid guys much.  He knew Jerax as an Earth Spirit spammer, and Matumabaman was on the Finnish stack previously, but not much more
- Liquid was very different to other teams
- Kuroky did things in a very respectful way, and he in turn has so much respect for him
- Kuroky introduced him as coach, and asked team to respect him
- One of his favourite teams to coach
- Team was relatively-unknown, but they were hardworking and respectful.  In contrast to the NA professionals he's been with
- They got top 2 at Shanghai, gaining respect from the team
- Talked with Kuroky a lot about Dota.  Which is great, because he can talk all day about Dota
- After TI6, he got a lot of offers.  Jerax left Liquid and joined OG, and asked him to come with him.  Kuroky also asked him to join Liquid
- Ended up joining Liquid as position 5.  Unfortunately, as previously stated, his 5 was still awful.  He didn't play well, and was deservedly kicked for GH
- Kind of stung that they won TI after they kicked him
- People were memeing him - he had failed with EG, Secret and Liquid in quick succession
- Wanted to go back to his roots, and form his own team with friends
- Found Abed
- Mason wanted to make a team with him
- DuBu was his favourite 5 that year.  Great shotcaller, and plays fast Dota that he enjoyed
- Team Onyx: Mason, Demon, Abed, DuBu and himself
- Switched to 4, his favourite role (anything but 5)
- Later kicked Demon for Forev
- Although they didn't do great at TI7, he enjoyed the experience

### Coaching EG permanently (01:26:00)
- DuBu didn't want to play with Mason, so he and Forev left
- New team with shuffles: Moonmeander, Mason, Abed, MSS, and himself - team was a disaster
- Moonmeander, Mason and himself constantly butted heads
- Can't remember what role he played
- Abed is probably the best teammate he's ever played with.  This is when he started to love SEA players - low ego, hard-working, high-skilled, and want to learn
- Abed left, despair set in (although he thought Abed would have no issues finding a team, so was happy for him)
- Realised at this point he cannot win TI as a player.  9th-16th maybe but not more.  He had to sacrifice his desire to win TI as a player in some way
- Free agent at this point, looking to make a team with SEA players, or coach
- Was offered EG coach role.  This was a big decision - effectively giving up his playing career
- Initially wanted to coach but only until TI8.  Maybe if he won TI as a coach, he could be able to play on a good team again.  That was his main goal.  He didn't want to let go of his dream of winning TI as a player
- **SUNSfan:** Question for yourself and Synderen - how did this journey feel?  Knowing you cannot win TI as a player?  Is it a gradual thing, or an ultimatum?
  - **Synderen:** Thinks it's a gradual thing for most players - drive and skill dwindle.  Remember that many players still vanish, and talent (casting/analysis/coaching isn't for everyone)
  - **BuLba:** Thinks that if he didn't have Phil or Charlie, he would have quit playing when he realised he can't play Dota at a high level any more
- Grateful for all the hard truths over the years in retrospect

### To TI8 (01:32:00)
- Roles were utterly messed-up when he joined [ed: This was Arteezy, Fear, offlane Sumail, Cr1t- and Misery]
- Team did not get along
- Shuffle: Added s4 and Fly
- Post-shuffle, the egos were low, and everyone was humble, considering the team's struggles that year
- Coaching-wise, thought this was the best team he'd been on that could win TI in the last few years
- Lots of respect for Fly: loyal friend [ed: his words, not mine], very easy to talk to, and very smart - just a really good person as a whole
- 3rd at TI8 - clearly not bad, but disappointing as our strategies were good and everyone was playing well
- Didn't think much of OG at TI8 (nobody did).  But TI9 OG - god-tier team
- Big decision - continue as coach or go back to playing?  He had offers to go back playing
- However, it felt like EG had unfinished business in terms of winning TI
- Considered Arteezy to be better than ana overall, Sumail was still a great player, and they had the best supports in the tournament
- Thus decided to continue to coach

### To TI9 (01:37:00)
- New season: Top 2 at some tournaments, but not winning
- Getting high placements got to the players' heads
- Going into TI9 - the team was fairly lazy, and not as humble or hardworking at TI8
- Got 5th-6th, clearly not bad but really disappointing in the end, wanted top 3 at the very least

### COVID season and to TI10 (01:37:45)
- Got Abed and Ramzes, losing Sumail and s4.  Doesn't want to get into the drama of the departure [ed: Maybe to do with Sumail's contract and nobody wanting to buy him out]
- Ramzes - why bring a carry player to the offlane?  If anyone watched Ramzes' performances over the last few years, you'd know why.
- Thought Ramzes was a really good offlaner for EG
- DreamLeague Season 13 - EG got second with this roster
- COVID happened
  - Abed couldn't play, Ramzes couldn't play
  - He had to stand in for EG too
- **PSA to all gamers:** Do your exercises
  - Had back pains.
  - Had a herniated disc injury, that he had to have an operation on
- During COVID season, they won some tournaments, and he got to tell other players they're losing to a 30-year-old washed-up offlaner
- Ramzes left - he got tired playing offlane in pubs
- Got iceiceice - everyone respected him on the team
- With the DPC back on schedule, the team was somewhat back on track.  They kept a lot of ideas and attitude from the previous roster, despite the change
- Singapore Major - lost 2-3 to IG.  Awful feeling.  Game 3 should have been theirs, but Kaka was too good
- Second at next Major too
- 2nd place 3 times in a row sounds bad but the consistency should be applauded.  It's not easy to constantly place high at Majors
- This team played really well and worked hard.  Teams were specifically preparing for them
- TI postponement ruined their momentum.  They basically had a 3 month break.  Cyberpunk 2077 also came out during this time, which didn't help (laughs)
- During the break, they didn't play some tournaments, a mistake in retrospect
- Coming into TI10, they felt confident - TI8 vibes
- Unfortunately, they bombed out.  The whole team was very frustrated and upset
- They were bad in the group stage.  There were lots of things affecting the team; they had a bad strategy; and players were acting differently than earlier in the year
- Before the tournament, he said to the team: No matter the result, he wanted team to stick together.  Thought they had a great thing going.  The team was great, and they were playing beautiful Dota...

### To TI11 (01:46:00)
- ...  Bad decisions were made - changes for the sake of making changes
- Team Spirit winning felt like new players were taking over
- Has known Nightfall for a while, and was convinced the Ramzes experiment would have worked, so this could have done so too
- Fly kicked - one of the biggest regrets he's had
- Felt that the top placements were being taken for granted - got complacent
- With Jerax, a close friend, maybe his addition was also thinking with his heart rather than his head
- Felt bad for Nightfall with visa issues (Ukraine war).  In one circumstance, he had to go to Mexico City last-minute with him.  They had to bootcamp in 3 different locations too.  The situation was understandably bad for Nightfall
- Due to visa issues, they had MSS stand-in temporarily too
- Discovered that (in hindsight) without Fly, there was no leader on the team
- Felt bad for Jerax and Nightfall - the situation was clearly dreadful for them
- Fly came back.  This was humbling for the team, of course, but a good thing
- Ahead of TI11, they had a pretty decent bootcamp
- Their scrim winrate was insane all season, even pre-Stockholm Major - 80-90%.
  - In previous years - scrims were thrown thanks to Arteezy and Sumail (still loves them of course)
  - Hard to fix things when your practice games go so well - what do you fix?
  - OG manager spoke to him - apparently EG were amongst the strongest teams they scrimmed with
  - Very good against LGD in scrims too
- TI group stages - amazing, basically like scrims
- Not perfect - they had communication issues, something that had happened all year
- Some people thought it was stupid to pick Thunder Awaken.  But EG had scrimmed them all season and beat them all the time.  Thunder Awaken also cancelled scrims against them in the past.  Felt they knew their style and they didn't change much.  Matthew asked him why they picked - it was because they beat them a lot all the time
- Technical issues around audio didn't help
- Communication-wise, wasn't sure why this happened, but this was not the same team, in terms of communication, from the group stages
- Still trying to think what he could have done better as a coach for the team
- Thinks he did a bad job helping the team recover

### To present-day (01:57:15)
- Nightfall left, wanted to play with his friends.  Maybe similar thoughts to what he did before - chasing names instead of what he was comfortable with
- Didn't want to make the same mistake - change for the sake of change
- Still thinks Fly is a great captain; Cr1t- one of the best 4s; Arteezy played like a god at TI; Abed best mid.  On paper, this is still a great team
- **Synderen:** You said when you lose, it's always more complicated than it sounds.  In the community, when EG does bad, you're the biggest lightning rod for criticism.  Nobody gets as much hate as you do for losses.  How do you cope with that?
  - Skin has grown thicker but not because of his diet (laughs).
  - Dr. K helped.  (Dr. K helped himself, Arteezy and Fly.  Worked with them for free for a year)
  - Trying to avoid social media in general.  Doesn't affect him as much as it used to.
  - Might be karma for putting himself out there in the past
- **SUNSfan:** Why Storm Spirit? (02:01:15)
  - The team that won that tournament picked it
  - He's not forcing Abed to play it
  - If 33 kept picking Doom and lost with it, everyone would have laughed at him too.  But that's with hindsight.  You're judging his Storm Spirit pick with hindsight too
- **SUNSfan:** Have you ever second-guessed yourself picking Storm Spirit? No.  He doesn't care what people think
- Most people don't know what goes on in a Dota team anyway

## Q&A (02:04:30)
- **SUNSfan:** How did Shopify Rebellion happen?
  - Learnt during the process
  - Rough year - the organisation saw an opportunity
  - Maybe if they had beaten Thunder Awaken, this doesn't happen
  - Thinks (ex-) Thunder Awaken deserve it, and are happy for them
  - Lots of respect for them, especially Matthew, who had a rough few years
  - This roster is usually overshadowed by Beastcoast
  - Matthew is a really good captain, and he took them far
- After talking to Shopify Rebellion, he got a family vibe from them.  Thinks senior figures are smart
- Heading to Toronto in January for bootcamp
- Thinks Saberlight will be a good addition to the team
- Laughed hard at his parody of the Nigma announcement, can't stop watching
- He likes joking around, maybe too much, but thinks he'll be a funny guy to be around for the team
- **Synderen:** Is it a net positive to have a clown on a team?  How many clowns are too many?  Are you a clown?
  - For this team, he'll be a good fit
  - A bit similar to iceiceice in some ways
  - Saberlight has improved a lot last year.  He was really good at Stockholm, and as a carry at Arlington
  - Fishman praised Saberlight for his work ethic despite struggling with his new role
  - Hard to make teams when you're always being judged in hindsight
  - Sometimes he can be too analytical - not just skill, but needs to judge the human aspects too (how they fit into the team, personality-wise)
- **SUNSfan:** What do you think about the current state of Dota, and what do you want to change?
  - Terrain changes is an easy one
  - Current patch feels pretty good
  - Usually fine with any patch anyway
  - Last few patches feel very "nerdy", everyone goes into intense detail into mechanics
  - Might be why these new young players do so well - all they do is play Dota
- **SUNSfan:** Big patches or small patches?
  - Will take whatever he gets
  - Can't really expect or guess changes
  - Loves reading patch notes
  - Wouldn't mind taking away some neutral camps
- **SUNSfan:** Second Roshan?
  - **BuLba:** Is this your idea?
  - **SUNSfan:** I pitch this to everyone.  Remember, a lot of stupid things I've said before have gone into the game eventually.  Imagine if there are two pits, one in the old location.  When Roshan dies, he spawns in the opposite cave.
  - **BuLba:** Why don't you do this in your custom games?  (**SUNSfan:** PoG apparently has something like this)
  - Doesn't play custom games in general

### Trivia (02:13:14)
Note: For a trivia buff, apparently BuLba asked terrible questions

- **SUNSfan:** What is BuLba's favourite food?  Pizza, burger, curry, ramen?
- **Synderen:** Curry (correct).  Would have been harder if he asked 4 Indian options.
- **SUNSfan:** What is the song Synderen has listened to the most?  The Quiet Place by In Flames; Adagio for Strings by Tiesto; Slam by Pendulum; or Changes by Tupac
- **BuLba:** Doesn't know the first one, knows Tiesto is EDM, thinks Pendulum is alternative, Tupac is rap.  Synderen won't give hints.  So between EDM and rap, EDM (wrong).  It's The Quiet Place by In Flames.
- **SUNSfan:** What is BuLba's first Dota team (1 or 2)?  Team Pandemic, EG, Complexity, Team Liquid
- **Synderen:** Team Pandemic (because it wasn't mentioned) (correct)
- **SUNSfan:** Which of the following makes for a truly magificent party trick that Synderen can do?  Lick elbow, make a very high-pitched voice, recite pi to 50dp or vibrate his right cheek?
- **BuLba:** Recalls a story - apparently Synderen will fart in front of people after eating Indian food, so it's that (not an answer provided).  Apparently this is true, but technically, it's a wrong answer.  The correct answer is: vibrate his right cheek (shows it off on camera).
- **SUNSfan:** What is BuLba's favourite movie?  The Two Towers, Dark Knight, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Avatar
  - **Synderen:** Thinks The Two Towers is the worst, so it's Dark Knight (wrong).
  - **BuLba:** It's The Two Towers.  Helm's Deep was a godly scene.
  - **Synderen:** That 45 minute fight scene should have been 5 minutes.  Worst part of the movie.  Doesn't advance the plot.
  - Also some random debates about Avatar
- **SUNSfan:** What is Synderen's dog name when translated to English?  Tomato, carrot, leek or onion?
- **BuLba:** Carrot (wrong)
- **SUNSfan:** Congratulations, the trivia buff got all the trivia questions wrong
